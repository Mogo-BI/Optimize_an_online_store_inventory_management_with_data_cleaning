# Optimize_an _online_store_inventory_management_with_data_cleaning

<h1>I. Context</h1>

I did a consulting mission like BI Analyst in **BottleNeck**, a famous wine seller who do online sale.

This firm wished to bring together her **ERP** (Enterprise Resource Planing) with an other file containing informations about products sold online.

The aim of this reconciliation was to get the sales revenue by product, and global.

They also wished to know if they had input errors on produtcs prices. So I needed to detect if they had outliers, to list them and to do a graphic for more readability.

<h1>II. Methodology</h1>
  <h2>1. Exploratory data analysis </h2>
    <li>Count rows & columns, duplicates, unique keys and Null or Nan values </li>
    <li>Identification and removal of errors and duplicates</li>
    <li>Remove elements not necessary for analysis</li>

  <h2>2. Merging files</h2>
    <li>Merging the different files provided to be able to do more analysis</li>
    <li>Choose attributes and methods (sides) for merging</li>
    <li>Ensure the correspondence of rows during the merge</li>
    <li>Export the dataset in a .XLSX file for the manager</li>
    
  <h2>3. Univariate analysis</h2>
    <li>Performing multiple univariate analysis using different statistical methods (Z-score, Interquartile range, 20/80)</li>
    <li>Inform the client about the possible limits of the analysis</li>
    <li>Creating visualizations with Plotly to be more impactful in my communication</li>
    <li>Define the actions to take next to have a better dataset</li>
